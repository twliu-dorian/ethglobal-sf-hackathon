Overview
ChainSplash is a decentralized donation platform designed to revolutionize group fundraising by focusing on specific target wishlists. Unlike traditional donation systems where funds are collected into a general pool, ChainSplash ensures that donations are directed towards predefined items, providing transparency and trust for donors, NGOs, and receivers alike. Leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, our platform guarantees that funds are allocated precisely as intended, eliminating intermediaries and safeguarding against misuse.
